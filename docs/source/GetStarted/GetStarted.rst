Get Started
===================
The Numerous engine is a package for modeling and simulating systems in Python.
It is a Python library that provides a high-level, pythonic interface for defining systems of equations and running
simulations of these systems. The Numerous engine is designed to be flexible and easy to use,
and can handle a wide range of  system models.
It is designed to be highly scalable and can handle large, complex models efficiently.

How to install it?
----------------
To install using pip use::

$pip install numerous-engine


Quick start
----------------
You can get started quickly here with a simple example:

.. code::

    from numerous.engine import model, simulation
    from numerous.examples.dampened_oscillator.dampened_oscillator import OscillatorSystem
    #Define simulation
    s = simulation.Simulation(
         model.Model(OscillatorSystem('system')),
        t_start=0, t_stop=10, num=100, num_inner=100, max_step=0.1
    )
    #Solve
    s.solve()
    simulation_result = s.model.historian_df
